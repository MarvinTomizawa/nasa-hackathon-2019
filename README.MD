# Planet games
## Idea:
Add a new planet into the solar sistem.

For adding a new planet first the player will need to add some caracteristics into it, gathering data from other planets.

But when the player arrives in the solar system he finds a tragedy waiting for him.

The sun lost his caracteristics (Got weeak and is fading) because the planets forgot who they are and what is the importance that the sun have in their lives.

The player must go to each planet and make them remember who they are, by answering some questions from them.

When a planet remeber who he is he gather back his strenght and say a caracteristic of the sun to help the sun recover his forces and return his original form.

After that the player must choose a caracteristic of the planet that he saved to add it in his new planet that will be inserted in the solar system.
